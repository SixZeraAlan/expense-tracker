## User Story

```
    Expense tracking is an important part of creating a budget for individuals and small business.  
    Keeping a daily record of your expenses by tracking receipts, invoices and other outgoing expenses  
    improves the financial health of your budget. Tracking expenses can help you stay on top of your    
    cash flow and prepare you for tax season.
